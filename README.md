# Toontown Stride
A build of Toontown Stride, that just works.

# ❓ What is Toontown Stride
Toontown Stride is a Community Focused Toontown Server. We are going to keep up this tradition finishing and polishing Toontown Stride for the community.

#❗ Notice
This source is only intented for archival/support reasons. (i.e: exploring the game by yourself or with a few friends to see what Stride was like, or for servers that are still running on Stride's base that want to move to Python 3 without any hassle.)

We **highly** recommend that you don't build a modern private server/source based on Stride.

This source has many bugs and potential vulnerabilities/exploits that are not present in modern sources. Not only that, this source also contains many offensive words/slurs in the commits and code itself.

We instead recommend using Toontown School House. A version written in Python 3 can be found in this organization.
